Performing Bayesian inference on probabilistic context free grammars using WebPPL and python

programinduction.wppl employs WebPPL to compute the posterior probability that a given set of strings was generated by a set of grammars.

metropolis_hastings.ipynb implements the Metropolis Hastings algorithm to compute the posterior distribution of parameters that define a grammar observing some strings generated by it.
